quest.description,A scenario for Mansions of Madness Second Edition.\n\n<b>What you expect to be a normal journey, turns out to be more traumatic than you could have imagined.</b>\n\nThis Scenario requires tiles and monsters from the following Expansions:\n\nMansions of Madness First Edition or Recurring Nightmares\nSupressed Memories\nBeyond the Threshold\n\nPlease remember to use the Items menu in game, it will be used quite extensively in this scenario.\n\n<i>If you find any bugs, issues or would like to comment on this Scenario. Please open an Issue on my GitHub repository at the following location:\n\nhttps://github.com/scrubbless/PublishedScenarios/issues</i>
\n\nYour trip to Newport was meant to be a days boat ride down the Merrimac river with a short stop to refuel in Little Amesbury, however the sudden onset of the storm had thrown your bearings and your captain has been unable to identify its refueling stop.
\n"By ma guess this should be Greyton. It's a small village along this stretch, must'a overshot Little Amesbury durin' the thick o' the storm, shoulda seen there a few hours past. Should be able ta moor at the dock an' refuel once tha storm 'as passed".
UIInvestigationCompleteFleeText.uitext,You run through the streets of Ambersby, the howls of the creatures echoing through the streets, they are right on your heels. Leaping onto the boat you scream at the Captain to get moving, frantically trying to fuel the ship. Before you have finished the refuel, the Captain un-lashes the boat and kicks it from the dock. Creatures leap at the boat in a futile attempt to reach you, failing they splash into the sea and sink , one by one.\n\nYou look back at the town with a pang of guilt. What fate have you left the people of Ambersby? Will they be able to survive long enough for you to find help?\n\nCongratulations, you have escaped the doomed village of Ambersby. Lets hope that help can be found in time for that poor town.\n\nThe Investigation is complete.\n(There are three other alternate endings to this Scenario)
\nThe captain is gripping the wheel tight, trying to keep the bobbing boat upright in the turbulant waters. You had set off this very morning, forcast for a smooth sail down the Merrimac River, expecting to arrive at Newbury Port by early evening. One fueling stop was scheduled, however due to the storm the captain was unable to make land as expected.
\nYour eyes lock on the fuel guage, close to empty and your nerves begin to fray. The captain also frequently glances in the same direction and appears to be becoming more anxious, sweat beading on his brow. He had previously mentioned that he did not want to risk damage to the hull by mooring on the banks in this weather, prefering to push on as long as possible and find a dock, jetty or slip.
UISplashScreenText.uitext,<b>~Stress and Strain~</b>\n\nThe rain lashes down around you as you huddle in the ship's cabin. The storm came on suddenly and unexpected, you shiver as the cold begins to take hold. \n\nThe captain is gripping the wheel tightly, trying to keep the bobbing ship upright in the turbulent waters. You had set off this very morning, forecast for a smooth sail down the Merrimac River, expecting to arrive at Newbury Port by early evening. One fueling stop was scheduled, however due to the storm the captain was unable to make land as expected. \n\nYour eyes lock on the fuel gauge, which shows close to empty; your nerves begin to fray. The captain also frequently glances in the same direction and appears to be becoming more anxious, sweat beading on his brow. \n\nYou jump as the captain exclaims - "Lights! It must be a dock". The tension eases as you ponder the prospect of a warm bed and a full belly. \n\nThe ship sputters and lurches forward, you can now just about make out a light, the captain must have good eyes.\n\nThe captain calls for you to prepare to moor.

EventSheriffOfficeWhatsHappened_Tile15.text,Honestly, I don't know. It all happened a couple of weeks back. A ship docked in the harbour, when I enquired the mayor told me to not get involved. So naturally I asked around a bit. Apparently some high profile Doctor was stopping here on her way through, but I found it odd she was still here a week later.\n\nAnyway, a week or so ago I was moving my boat to the shop for repairs when I saw the Research group hastily board their ship and depart. I found it odd, they left most of their cargo on the dock and even a couple of their Researchers behind. You can find them with the rest of the folk downstairs.\n\nLater that same day there were reports of people falling ill, an emergency infirmary to care for the sick was set up next door. Then a few days later violence began to erupt in the streets. Frightened townsfolk turned up in my office trying to find a safe place. I took as many as I could in and set up a broadcast to tell people to come here.\n\nHowever with the groups of creatures roaming the streets i've had to block and barricade the door.
